Repository for the modpack, Magic and Metallum Reignited

<h2>
  What is Magic and Metallum Reignited?
</h2> 
<p>
  Magic and Metallum Reignited re-introduces one of the largest packs I've built, it's initial creation, a few years ago, focused on the kitchen-sink type mods I've always loved from 1.7.10. This pack sways from that mindset in a few ways. The largest of all is the focus on exploration. I've always wanted a pack where the player can go anywhere and feel like they are experiencing something new wherever they go.

<h2>
  Current focuses?
</h2>
<p>
  I'm currently focused on fleshing the pack out to a fuller extent, this includes editing recipes and improving performance across the pack. I'm also planning on changing and balancing the many mods currently in the pack as some of them tend towards being too powerful. My philosophy is that limiting the player to an extent is key in adding challenge and creativity to their playstyle. Finding innovative solutions to challenges is, to me, what Minecraft is all about.
